# :man_technologist: Portfolio Website

This is my custom portfolio website made using _HTML_, _CSS_ and _JavaScript_.

The website is deployed to **GitHub Pages** and can be found [here](https://schmelto.github.io/Portfolio/).

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)

## How to start?

### Install and develop on local machine

To run the project locally on your computer please clone the project using this command `git clone` and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

> This Project uses **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** and **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)**.

Due the project only uses _HTML_, _CSS_ and _JavaScript_ you can access the website on you local machine by opening the `index.html`-file with your favorite browser or by running `npm start`.

### Add another project to the website

The projects shown on the website are being accessed through the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and can be maintained by modifing the [scripts.js](./js/scripts.js).

```js
let githubprojects = [
  {
    name: 'schmelto/100-days-of-code',
    icon: 'description',
  },
];
```

- **name**: username/repository (GitHub)
- **icon**: icon you want to display for the project (using [Google Font Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons))

> Due to lots of projects using icons in their project description the script in [js/scripts.js](./js/scripts.js) remove the github icons.
>
> ```js
> project.description.replace(/:[^}]*:/, '');
> ```
